```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Goal for the rest of class...

Oh gosh, my project has changed pretty drastically just now... But I am expecting to do regression plots or anovas. For now, I will focus on the homework.

Immediately I am struggling with Question one.. it seems like the file is already downloaded to projects/homeworks as an .Rmd file... okay, went to homework and used that link and changed two to three. that worked.

First push worked! yay!

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
